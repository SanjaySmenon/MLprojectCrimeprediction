Predicting Crime Domains in India Using Machine Learning and SMOTE
1. Introduction
Crime prediction is a critical area of research that empowers law enforcement agencies to anticipate and prevent criminal activities effectively. This case study presents a machine learning approach for predicting crime domains (types of crimes) using contextual and demographic data.

By combining the Random Forest Classifier with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), the model addresses class imbalance — ensuring fair and accurate predictions across diverse crime categories.
2. Dataset Overview
The dataset used, `crime_dataset_india.csv`, provides detailed information about crime incidents across various Indian cities.

Key Attributes:
- Date and Time of Occurrence
- City
- Victim’s Age and Gender
- Weapon Used
- Number of Police Deployed
- Crime Domain (Target Variable)

Data preprocessing involved handling missing values and extracting temporal features such as year, month, weekday, hour, and minute for pattern analysis.
3. Methodology / Approach
The project followed a structured machine learning pipeline comprising data cleaning, feature engineering, class balancing, and model training.

a) Data Preprocessing
- Missing numerical values were replaced using median imputation, while categorical columns used mode imputation.
- Label encoding converted categorical variables (e.g., City, Gender, Weapon Used) into numerical form.

b) Handling Imbalance with SMOTE
The dataset exhibited class imbalance, with some crime types underrepresented.
SMOTE was applied to synthetically generate samples of minority classes, creating a balanced dataset that promotes unbiased model learning.

c) Model Building: Random Forest Classifier
A Random Forest Classifier with 200 estimators was trained on the resampled data.
This model was selected for its robustness against overfitting, capability to handle both categorical and numerical data, and strong performance in pattern recognition tasks.

d) Evaluation Metrics
The model’s performance was measured using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
4. Results and Discussion
The trained Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 73.21%, showcasing strong predictive capability.

Confusion Matrix:
[[1895  267   67   73]
 [ 146 1643  102  420]
 [  44  106 2080   38]
 [ 277  774  145 1103]]

Classification Report:

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|:------|:-----------:|:--------:|:----------:|:---------:|
| 0 | 0.80 | 0.82 | 0.81 | 2302 |
| 1 | 0.59 | 0.71 | 0.64 | 2311 |
| 2 | 0.87 | 0.92 | 0.89 | 2268 |
| 3 | 0.68 | 0.48 | 0.56 | 2299 |

Overall Accuracy: 73%

- Confusion Matrix Heatmap – Visualizes performance across crime categories.
- SMOTE Distribution Plot – Shows data balancing after applying SMOTE.
6. Prediction Example
An example input to the trained model demonstrates its real-world usability.

Example Input:
City: Pune
Victim Age: 25
Victim Gender: Female
Weapon Used: Blunt Object
Police Deployed: 5
Occur Year: 2025
Occur Month: 10
Occur Day: 3
Occur Weekday: 3 (Thursday)
Occur Hour: 14
Occur Minute: 30

Predicted Output: Other Crime
Prediction Probabilities: [0.205, 0.43, 0.045, 0.32]
7. Conclusion
This case study demonstrates how machine learning can effectively support law enforcement in identifying and classifying crime domains.

By combining Random Forest with SMOTE resampling, the model successfully mitigates data imbalance and achieves reliable accuracy.

Future Enhancements:
- Incorporate geospatial and socioeconomic data
- Apply hyperparameter tuning and feature selection
- Integrate real-time prediction dashboards
